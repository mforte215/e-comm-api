## Installation

The application can be cloned from GitHub here: https://github.com/mforte215/e-comm-api. Once cloned, then navigate to the repo in the terminal and once inside, run 'npm install' to install any needed application dependencies. Once the web app dependencies are installed, a sample DB backend is provided. A db/schema.sql to create the database, and then a index.js in the seeds folder which will create and populate the tables in your DB from your model and association definitions. Once the DB is seeded, to start the program, run 'npm start'.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can navigate to localhost:3001, and test various provided endpoints such as:

- http://localhost:3001/api/categories
- http://localhost:3001/api/products
- http://localhost:3001/api/tags
